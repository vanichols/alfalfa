River flows have a minimum level, if they aren't there irrigation is shut off. 
Alfalfa is rotated with a small grain (oats, barley, wheat). But it's grown for forage. 
Most producers do a top-dressing, maybe an at-planting application of N for their small grains.
50-100 lb N/ac, the alfalfa reduction credit may not be appropriate here. 

The source of water is definitely a mix of ground and surface. 
Ground wells range from 10-100 feet, and vary across the season. 
Historically this area was flood irrigated. Now he's unsure, maybe mostly wheel line, some center pivot. 
Water application efficiency (how much goes to soil/plant) is typically low for wheel line (60-70%), 
but could be higher with good management. 
Several flavors of irrigation can help. 
MESA (mid irrigation sprinkler application) uses high pressure to get even coverage, 80-90%
LESA uses less power
LEPA - best! A hose dragging on the ground, very low pressure, 95-98% efficiency
Remember these cause the 'irrigation dilemma', aquifer is not being recharged
Center pivots are usually electric?

Stand life could be longer than 6 years, but probably not shorter
Some do put insecticides/fertilizer in their irrigation water. Saves wheel traffic/soil compaction. 
He says if you have an electric center pivot and put the pesticides in the water, you save a lot of energy!

Partial irrigation is possible after establishment, could shut off for 3rd cutting. 
Need to look at book to figure out what that yield hit would look like (Intermountain alfalfa management)


Ask irrigation company:
Pump/pressure requirements for wheel lines/center pivots. 
Diesel vs gasoline vs electric
Look for company near Tulelake

Called Tulelake irrigation district 530-667-2249, useless
Called Alsco, Inc Red Bluff CA 530-527-4001, no answer
