Assumptions for typical irrigation schemas

Wheel lines - a pump that pressurizes a system



Runs at 50 psi?
Drop nozzles require a lower pressure, and is 15% more efficient

Defecit irrigation strategy --> rduction in the amount of water you apply, reduction in yield

Solar electric irrigation pumps
100 ac field, 1 acre for solar, you could take care of the 


Make a table - 

Location - ET demand, rainfall, number of cuts, water source 
MTn region uses pumped water
